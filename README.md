# Chinook  Digital Music Store SQL Analysis

## Project Description

This project is an in-depth SQL analysis of the Chinook Music Store database, a popular sample database representing a digital music store. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in SQL by answering business-related questions and performing advanced data analysis.

## Dataset Details

The Chinook database contains information about:

Customers

Invoices

Artists

Albums

Tracks

Employees

Genres

These tables collectively represent a real-world music store's data, making it ideal for practicing SQL queries and analysis.

# Objectives
